4. **Preview Page Implementation:**
   - Summary table showing all sections
   - For each variable:
     * Achieved score
     * Max possible score
     * Progress bar (achieved/max)
   - Section totals with star ratings:
     * 0-25%: ⭐
     * 26-50%: ⭐⭐
     * 51-75%: ⭐⭐⭐
     * 76-90%: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
     * 91-100%: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

5. **Technical Implementation:**
   - **Score Validation:**
     ```javascript
     // Frontend validation
     const validateScore = (value, max) => 
       value >= 0 && value <= max && !isNaN(value);
     ```
   - **Section Total Calculation:**
     ```javascript
     const sectionTotal = variables.reduce(
       (sum, {score}) => sum + score, 0
     );
     ```
   - **Overall Percentage:**
     ```javascript
     const maxPossible = sections.reduce(
       (sum, section) => sum + section.maxTotal, 0
     );
     const overallPercentage = (totalScore / maxPossible) * 100;
     ```
