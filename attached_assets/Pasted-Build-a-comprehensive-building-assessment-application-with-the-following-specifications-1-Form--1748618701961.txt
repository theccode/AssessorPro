Build a comprehensive building assessment application with the following specifications:

1. **Form Structure & Sequence:**
   - Building Information (BI) - First section (non-scored)
   - Site and Transport (ST)
   - Water Efficiency (WE)
   - Energy Efficiency (EEMR)
   - Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)
   - Materials & Resources (MR)
   - Waste & Pollution (WP)
   - Innovation (IN)

2. **Building Information Section (First Section):**
   - Non-scored descriptive fields:
     * Building Name (text)
     * Publisher Name (text)
     * Building Location (text)
     * Detailed Address (text)
     * Phone Number (tel)
     * Additional Notes (textarea)
   - Reference numbers: 1, n, 17, 14, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 (store as metadata)

3. **Scoring System Implementation:**
   Each variable has a maximum score (N) with range validation (0-N):

   - Innovative Technologies (Max: 11)
   - Sustainable Products (Max: 3)
   - Eco-Friendly Designs (Max: 7)

4. **Score Calculation Engine:**
   ```javascript
   // Per-variable validation
   const validateScore = (value, max) => value >= 0 && value <= max;
   
   // Category calculation
   const categoryScore = (variables) => 
     variables.reduce((sum, {value}) => sum + value, 0);
   
   // Overall percentage
   const maxPossible = 14 + 15 + 10 + 2 + 7 + 14 + 11; // = 73
   const overallPercentage = (totalScore / maxPossible) * 100;
