3. **User Management:**
   - 3 roles: Admin, Assessor, Client
   - Assessors: Create/manage assessments, input scores
   - Clients: View subscribed reports, track building performance
   - Admins: Manage users, configure scoring, generate analytics

4. **Subscription System:**
   - Tiered access (Basic/Pro/Enterprise)
   - Stripe integration for payments
   - Client dashboard with assessment history
   - PDF report generation for completed assessments

5. **Technical Implementation:**
   - **Frontend:** React with Material-UI components
   - **Backend:** Node.js/Express REST API
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
   - **Scoring Engine:** Automated calculation of:
        Category Score = Σ(achieved points)
        Overall Score = Σ(category scores)
        Percentage Score = (Overall Score / Total Possible) × 100
   - **Visualization:** Chart.js for score breakdowns

6. **Key Features:**
   - Dynamic forms with field-specific max scores
   - Score progress bars showing 0/N status
   - Historical score tracking for buildings
   - Comparison tools against industry benchmarks
   - Mobile-responsive assessment interface
   - Audit trail for all score modifications

7. **Deployment:**
   - Docker containerization
   - AWS deployment (EC2 + RDS + S3)
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
